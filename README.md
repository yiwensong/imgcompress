# imgcompress - 現代の圧縮 ( 美 学 A E S T H E T I C S )

### Modern compression for the modern aesthete. (現代壓縮 4 2 0 為現代 э с т е т а .)

####[\# S A D B O Y S](http://instagram.com/ineverwin)

Using advanced algorithms technology, we have created a compression algorithm that has a local compression ratio of 
over 140 000. 
The future is here, Web 3.0 enabled, Python 2.7 running, Big Data storing, Analytics enhancing, cutting edge technology.

## Requirements  

* Anaconda (Python 2.7)
* Imgur API

To install Imgur API, simply do:  

    pip install imgurpython

You must also register the application yourself [here](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient). 
When you get your key and secret, replace the first and second line of secret.secret with your key and secret, respectively. 
  
## Usage

To compress:

    python imgcompress.py -c <FILE> -t <DEST>
  
To decompress:

    python imgcompress.py -d <.IMGC FILE> -t <DEST>

## Inspiration

[WPEG Compression Algorithm](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/wpeg.html) is a theoretical compression algorithm that can get infinite local compression ratio. **現代の圧縮 ( 美 学 A E S T H E T I C S )** is a practical implementation of the WPEG algorithm that uses advanced Web3.0 technology and post-現代ism 美学 to create the most advanced 420 圧縮 (compression) algorithm in the world.

## What it does

**現代の圧縮 ( 美 学 A E S T H E T I C S )** turns any file under 5MB into a file of just 7 bytes. This compression ratio is well over 140 000, which is significantly higher than any other popular compression algorithm available today. Using **現代の圧縮 ( 美 学 A E S T H E T I C S )**, we can expect an increased efficiency in Big Data storage as well as new, cutting-edge techniques in Data Analytics.  

**現代の圧縮 ( 美 学 A E S T H E T I C S )** uses the ポストアルゴリズムのプログラミングプラグマ (post-algorithmic programming pragma), the deconstruction of the use of complex algorithms to increase the compression ratios of large files. Instead, we took an 盒子外面 (out-of-the-box) solution that incorporates the cutting-edge technology of the Imgur API and the losslessness property of files under 5MB uploaded to Imgur. Thus, we simply upload *any* file in 5MB chunks encoded as PNG files *( 美 学 A E S T H E T I C S )* and store these as 7 bit characters which are the URLs of these images as Imgur gives them. Treating Imgur as a 無限のストレージボックス (infinity storage box), we can compress any large file with a compression ratio of nearly one million.

## How I built it

Using the newest version of Python2 and Anaconda (the one that doesn't suck), we created the most up-to-date and versatile CaaS (サービスとしての圧縮 Compression-as-a-Service) platform available. **現代の圧縮 ( 美 学 A E S T H E T I C S )** takes the concept of SaaS and further applies it to be the most relevant towards Cloud Computing/Big Data Analytics as possible. With the state-of-the-art Imgur API (アプリケーション・プログラマーのインターフェース), we created the fastest, most efficient, and bleeding-edgiest compression software available; all in under 200 lines of code.

## Challenges I ran into

Learning to program was pretty hard, the Imgur API had really convenient calls but I was too lazy to read the API documentation, I had to finish some homework so I was a bit pressed on time, this documentation took *wayyyyy* too long.  
Also I needed to figure out how this relates to the sponsors to pretend like I'm qualified for prizes (I'm not really, but this worked on my Windows 10 machine so I applied for the Microsoft マイクロソフト prize).

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Incorporated the elements of V A P O R W A V E completely unnecessarily into a Hackathon project. Made a **圧縮アルゴリズム ( C O M P R E S S I O N A L G O R I T H M )** that is one of the most consistent and efficient. One more project to my resume I guess.

## What I learned

Python, coding, Imgur API, V A P O R W A V E, **( 美 学 A E S T H E T I C S )**, the post-programming pragma.

## What's next for 現代の圧縮 ( 美 学 A E S T H E T I C S )

**現代の圧縮 ( 美 学 A E S T H E T I C S )** is taking CaaS Big Data Analytics/SaaS/Cloud Computing to exciting new directions. What the future holds for us is not simply 現代の圧縮, but 現代のコンピュー (modern computing) in general. With the invention of the Turing Complete Machine, many more problems will become feasible and we may one day even find a solution to the
